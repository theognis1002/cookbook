Improving PostgreSQL performance at the database level involves various strategies and techniques. Here are the top 10 ways to enhance PostgreSQL performance:

1. Optimize Queries

   - Use `EXPLAIN`: Analyze queries using `EXPLAIN` to understand execution plans and identify bottlenecks.
   - Indexes: Ensure appropriate indexing on columns used in `WHERE`, `JOIN`, and `ORDER BY` clauses. Avoid over-indexing.

2. Tune PostgreSQL Configuration

   - Memory Settings: Adjust `shared_buffers`, `work_mem`, and `maintenance_work_mem` based on available system memory and workload.
   - Autovacuum: Configure autovacuum settings to ensure timely vacuuming and analyze operations to maintain table statistics.
   - Transaction Isolation Levels: Adjust transaction level to manage concurrency and prevent issues like dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.

3. Use Proper Data Types

   - Choose Efficient Types: Use appropriate data types for columns. For example, use `INT` instead of `BIGINT` if possible, and prefer `VARCHAR(n)` over `TEXT` if a specific length is known.

4. Partition Large Tables

   - Table Partitioning: Divide large tables into smaller partitions based on range, list, or hash methods to improve query performance and manageability.

5. Vacuum and Analyze Regularly

   - `VACUUM`: Regularly run `VACUUM` to reclaim storage and avoid table bloat.
   - `ANALYZE`: Run `ANALYZE` to update table statistics used by the query planner for optimizing query performance.

6. Leverage Connection Pooling

   - PgBouncer: Use connection pooling tools like PgBouncer to manage database connections efficiently and reduce the overhead of establishing new connections.

7. Tune Indexes

   - Index Types: Use appropriate index types such as B-tree, GIN, or GiST based on query patterns.
   - Index Maintenance: Regularly monitor and maintain indexes to ensure they are used effectively and not causing overhead.

8. Optimize Disk I/O

   - Storage Configuration: Use fast storage solutions (e.g., SSDs) and configure PostgreSQL to optimize disk I/O operations.
   - Filesystem: Ensure the filesystem is properly configured for PostgreSQL workloads.

9. Improve Database Schema Design

   - Normalization: Design schemas with proper normalization to avoid redundancy and ensure data integrity.
   - Foreign Keys: Use foreign key constraints judiciously to maintain referential integrity without excessive performance costs.

10. Use Proper Backup and Restore Strategies

    - Backups: Implement efficient backup strategies, such as using pg_basebackup for full backups and pg_dump for logical backups.
    - Restore Testing
