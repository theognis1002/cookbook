Analyze the entire codebase to plan a refactor focused on simplicity, maintainability, and readability.

- Identify redundant or complex code and propose DRY, modular improvements.
- Rank refactor opportunities by impact (high → low).
- Highlight areas with high cyclomatic complexity or poor structure.
- Flag hardcoded values that should use enums, configs, or dynamic lookups.

Keep recommendations practical, minimal, and aligned with best practices.
